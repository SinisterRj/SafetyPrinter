# SafetyPrinter
This project aims to improve the safety of 3D FDM Printers by adding an external MCU (an Arduino) which increases your chance of preventing or mitigating a fire at your home.

_Safety Printer MCU assembly_

The project itself is very simple and designed to be cheap (the minimum needed is an Arduino nano and a few sensors). All you need is some time to assemble everything and test.

This project has a sibling project, the [Octoprint's Safety Printer plugin](https://github.com/SinisterRj/Octoprint_SafetyPrinter) which is optional but it's highly recommended as it helps you monitor your sensors and helps a lot during test phase:

You can find lots of information on [Wiki](https://github.com/SinisterRj/SafetyPrinter/wiki) and we recommend it's reading.
